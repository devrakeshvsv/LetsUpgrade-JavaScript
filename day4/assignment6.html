			Write a loop which prompts for a number greater than 100. If the
			visitor enters another number – ask them to input again.
			<br />
			The loop must ask for a number until either the visitor enters a
			number greater than 100 or cancels the input/enters an empty line.
			<br />
			Here we can assume that the visitor only inputs numbers. There’s no
			need to implement a special handling for a non-numeric input in this
			task.
