			Imagine you are going out to do some grocery shopping.
			<br />
			So you have an array called shoppingList with all the products you
			want to buy.
			<br />
			Now that you are inside of the shop, you have a basket with all the
			products from your list, but you want to add a few more.
			<br />
			Create a new array called shoppingBasket, that will be a copy of the
			shoppingList array, and add some new products into it.
